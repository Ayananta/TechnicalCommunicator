# About me
I help businesses make their software products, solutions, or services more usable by explaining them to their customers and providing guidance on the usage procedures. For the explanation and guidance, I write UI texts, create audio-visuals, write online helps and printed documentation, work on infographics and flowcharts, and write other product-related documents, like Release Notes, What's New, and Tech Notes. I also help product development teams by writing instructions on how to effectively use APIs.
